# Overview
A custumized typescript project to view and summarize different premier league games.I followed to use composite pattern by breaking the classes into sub modules which made the code more re-usable.
Works completly fine with inheritance too.(Raw file included)
 


## Running in your local machine



```http
  npm start
```
Configured with  nodemon and concurrently with compiler in watch mode.

More Analyzers can be added with the same pattern by only playing with type of MatchData.
Feel free to contribute.
